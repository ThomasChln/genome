## Medical guidance

While these results can not provide medical guidance, they can help physicians to perform personnalized tests, such as specific disease screening and evaluation of potential drug side effects.

Medical guidance can only be done with clinically validated studies, which are assesed by regulations authorities such as the EMA in the EU and the FDA in the USA. Neither the EBI catalog, nor SNPedia, nor 23andMe genotypes are clinically validated.

If you want to investigate further specific diseases risks markers, you should consult physicians to perform confirmatory tests.

## Genetics research

Physicians and geneticists struggle to understand the links between genomes and diseases. Only a few rare diseases can be reliably predicted in individuals. For most diseases with genetic components, markers only modify the risks, compared with the general population. Environmental factors are often strong predictors.

## Genetic sequencing

### Genotyping errors

> Even for processing that meets our high standards, a small, unknown fraction of the data generated during the laboratory process may be un-interpretable or incorrect (referred to as “Errors”).

### Privacy

> The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act was signed into law in the United States in 2008, and some, but not all, states and countries have laws that protect individuals with regard to their Genetic Information.

> Even if you share Genetic Information that has no or limited meaning today, that information could have greater meaning in the future as new discoveries are made.

### Misleading advertising

Genetic sequencing companies claims must also be met with caution.

In 2013, the FDA ordered 23andMe to stop providing health-related tests in the US, due to lack of clinical validations of their methods http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2013/ucm376296.htm. Following that, 2 customers filed class action lawsuits for misleading advertising.

In 2015, the FDA warned three other genetic sequencing companies to stop providing health-related genetic tests http://www.raps.org/Regulatory-Focus/News/2015/11/09/23563/FDA-Warns-Three-Companies-Over-DTC-Genetic-Tests/.
